### Run through various metrics:
# 1) Total Impressions served: In this case there were a total of 5000 impressions, not looking at this yet
# 2) Click Through Rate (CTR)
# Look at total click through rate
total_ctr <- sum(all_data$clicks)/ nrow(all_data)
# Out of 5000 impressions only 33 clicked through for 0.0066 or .66 % of people clicked. 
# Question: Now check percent of those that are muted: 11 were muted 
# Muted from those are: 0.4230769
# Non-muted: 0.5769231
########## POINT 1: Simple measuring of click through rate, muted impressions seem to have a little if not worse effect.
# However, almost double the number of impressions were served with sound 3606 were played with sound while 1394 were played
# without meaning, this is not a fair experiment. 
# Only > 1394/5000
# [1] 0.2788
# to begin with were served muted. So ratio of muted to non-muted is ~ 1394:3606 or 1:2.5
# Which means 11/1394 is a 0.0078909 rate, while 22/3606 is only .006100943 

# 3) Video Completion Rate (VCR) - % of impressions that played all the way to the end of the ad
# Out of 5000 impressions, 2554 impressions were completed 0.5108 or ~ 51% completed.
all_data_completed <- subset(all_data, all_data$completions != 0)
# Question: How many of those were muted? 892 of those were muted: 
perc_muted_from_completed <- nrow(all_data_completed[all_data_completed$sound == "FALSE",])/ nrow(all_data_completed)
# Muted from those are: 0.3492561
# Non-muted: 0.6507439
######### POINT 2: Simple measuring of VCR, muted impressions seem to have little if not worst effect. 
# Again look at ratio of test comparison. 892/2554 were completed- thats a 0.6398852 which is 64%  vs 
# > 1662/3606
# [1] 0.4608985

# 4) Viewability
# > table(all_data$viewable)

# FALSE  TRUE 
#  3407  1593 
# Out of 5000 impressions, 1593 of them were viewable or 0.3186 ~ 32% viewable
all_data_viewable <- subset(all_data, all_data$viewable == 'TRUE')
# Question: How many of those were muted? 605 of those were muted: 
perc_muted_from_viewable <- nrow(all_data_viewable[all_data_viewable$sound == "FALSE",])/ nrow(all_data_viewable)
# Muted from those are: 0.3797866
# Non-muted from those are:  0.6202134
######## POINT 3: Simple measuring of Viewability, muted impressions do not outperform
# however relative to number 605/ 1394 total - thats 0.4340029 or 43% 
# whereas non-muted is 988/3606 or 0.2739878 or 27 % 

### Conclusion- muted impressions actually are more performant. Based on the first three metrics.
# Now take a look at the fourth- 
all_data_bool_sound <- all_data
all_data_bool_sound$sound <- ifelse(all_data_bool_sound$sound == 'FALSE', 1, 0)
all_data_bool_sound$viewable <- ifelse(all_data_bool_sound$viewable == 'TRUE', 1, 0)

margin_df_cnt <- setNames(aggregate(adviewing_id~ campaign_id, all_data_bool_sound, length), c("campaign_id", "number_of_impressions"))
margin_df_price_mute <- setNames(aggregate(cbind(sound, clicks, completions, viewable, win_price)~ campaign_id, all_data_bool_sound, sum, na.rm = TRUE), c("campaign_id", "sum_muted","sum_clicks", "sum_completions", "sum_viewable", "sum_win_price"))

margin_df <- merge(margin_df_cnt, margin_df_price_mute, by="campaign_id")
margin_df$perc_muted <- margin_df$sum_muted / margin_df$number_of_impressions
margin_df$perc_clicks <- margin_df$sum_clicks / margin_df$number_of_impressions
margin_df$perc_completions <- margin_df$sum_completions / margin_df$number_of_impressions
margin_df$perc_viewable <- margin_df$sum_viewable / margin_df$number_of_impressions
margin_df$avg_impression_price <- margin_df$sum_win_price / margin_df$number_of_impressions
margin_df <- margin_df[order(-margin_df$perc_muted),]
#### Not sure that was helpful calculation considering- does not look like compaign costs in total prove to be any cheaper
# than campaigns with less perc_muted. This might be a reason to consider muted impressions more. 
margin_df_sub <- margin_df[,c("campaign_id", "number_of_impressions", "sum_win_price", "perc_muted", "perc_clicks", "perc_completions", "perc_viewable", "avg_impression_price")]


# Also check individual price from original dataset
price_df <- setNames(as.data.frame(cbind(all_data$win_price, all_data$sound)), c("win_price", "sound"))
price_df$sound <- ifelse(price_df$sound == 'FALSE', 1, 0)
plot(price_df)

library(ggplot2)
price_df <- setNames(as.data.frame(cbind(all_data$win_price*1000, all_data$sound, all_data$timestamp)), c("win_price", "sound", "timestamp"))
# price_df$sound <- ifelse(price_df$sound == 'FALSE', 1, 0)

qplot(timestamp, win_price, data = price_df, colour = sound)
# plot shows roughly even distribution of muted cost relative to non-muted cost- between averages above and plot here
# So not neccesarily more expensive, but also not neccesarily cheaper. 

#### Recommendations: 
# 1) We would want to run another test with equal number of muted and unmuted impressions to confirm numbers above.
# 2) Say we were able to confirm that again- that CTR, VCR and Viewability outperformed, we would 
# a) Want to ensure that we could serve as many muted impressions, is there a cap from the clients perspective on mutability?
# b) We could price combinations with higher percents of muted impressions as more expensive- better markup since it ensures 
# more clicks

# Questions: 
# Completion rate for muted impressions- will clients actually be happy with this? does this actually mean that they have just let the video
# run and not even viewed it
#  Take for example the following chart: 
# > margin_df

## Lets assume we have a contract of $20 per 1000 impressions
all_data_ten <- subset(all_data, all_data$win_price < 10.00)


# Letâ€™s take an example contract.  Say Nike has a contract with us to pay $40 for every 1,000 completions.  
# We end up serving 2,000 impressions, in order to get the 1,000 completions, at an average cost of $15 CPM.  
# In that case we had a VCR of 50% and a margin of 25%. Nike paid us $40 for the 1,000 completions, we paid the exchanges $30, ($40-$30)/$40=10%.
# Take another sample contract- if completion rate 


# Margin % - How much money are we making from this campaign? (client pays - win_price) / client pays
# win_price is what we pay exchange
# Question to answer: Which campaign had the most mutest impressions? Check out price relat
# group by campaign_id and make a decision with regard to whether or not, they were more expensive.
